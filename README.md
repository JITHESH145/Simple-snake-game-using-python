# Snake Game in Python

This project is a classic Snake game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game allows the player to control a snake that moves around the screen, eating food to grow longer. The game ends when the snake collides with itself.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Control the snake using the arrow keys to move up, down, left, or right.
- **Food Consumption**: The snake grows longer each time it eats the food that appears randomly on the screen.
- **Blinking Food**: The food item blinks to make it more visually interesting.
- **Collision Detection**: The game is over when the snake collides with itself.

## How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Simply run the Python script to start the game.
2. **Control the Snake**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to direct the snake.
3. **Eat the Food**: Guide the snake to the blinking food to grow longer.
4. **Avoid Crashing**: Try not to let the snake crash into itself, or the game will be over.
